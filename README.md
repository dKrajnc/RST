# Rule Set Table (RST)-based automated data preprocessing
This repository contains information about the RST concept, implemented by researchers of the Medical University of Vienna (MUV), Vienna, Austria. The development is conducted at the Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering (main developer: Denis Krajnc)
The RST concept provides a tabular data-based simple interface for clinicians who can provide simple preference rules for each typical data preprocessing algorithm incorporated into a data preprocessing pipeline. This way, each data preprocessing step can be influenced with optional or preferencial as well as with fixed rules.
The RST concept allows clinicians to incorporate domain knowledge into the process of automatically building a data preprocessing pipeline instead of manually preprocessing the given input data or instead of allowing the automated data preprocessing algorithm to perform any decision and acton based on mathematical / algorithmic rules.


## Intended Use
We explicitly state that the RST binary does not describe any product and it is not intended to be used in any real-life, especially not in clinical settings. This repository contains description and examples of a research tool for experimenting with data preprocessing approaches prior to conducting machine learning building processes on the data.
Therefore, the contents of this repository shall not be used either partly or fully for rendering clinical decisions or to be included in any product. We waive any liabilities for any damage caused by the executables.
